XByterun
--------

This is a fork of byterun. The aim here is to convert this to use xdis
and then we can have a cross Python-version and multi-version Python
interpreter.

Byterun is a pure-Python implementation of a Python bytecode execution
virtual machine.  Net Batchelder started it (based on work from Paul
Swartzh) to get a better understanding of bytecodes so he could fix
branch coverage bugs in coverage.py.
